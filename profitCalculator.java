Write a java program for following:  Maximum Profit on App Sales
In an online app marketplace, each app's price Fluctuates daily. You're given the prices of an app for the next N days and are tasked with buying and selling the app to maximize your profit. You can only 
make one transaction (buy once and sell once), and you must buy before you can sell. Write a Java function, maxProfit, that calculates the maximum profit you can achieve.

Condition:
â€¢ You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (you must sell the app before buying again).
If no profit is possible, return 0.
